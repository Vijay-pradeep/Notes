    Virtual machines and Network in cloud
        Virtual private cloud
            Connect google cloud resources to eachother and to the internet
            Segmenting networks
            using firewall rules to restrict access to instances
            Create static routes to forward traffic to specific destinations
            They are global and can have subnets in any google region worldwide
            Compatibilities
                Routing tables anre built-in
                No router provisining or managing
                Forward traffic from one instance to another
                No external IP address required
                Firewalls
                    Can be defined using network tag
            Type services
                VPC PEERING
                    VPC to VPC
                SHARED VPC
                    Vpc to other services like IAM
        Compute Engine
            VM
            Can be configured like a physical server
            Can be created via google cloud console, the google cloud CLI , or the compute engine API
            can run linux and windows server images
            can built and run images of other operating systemand flexibily reconfigure VMs
            Choosing the type needed to be used 
                Sustained use
                Committed-use discounts
                Preemptible & spot VMs

        Scaling
            Auto Scaling 
        Cloud Load Balancing
            Fully distributed, Software defined, managed services
            Supports scaling
            You can put cloud load balancing infront of your traffic
                HTTP(S)
                TCP traffic
                SSL traffic
                UDP traffic
            No "Pre warming" is required for anticipated spikes in traffic.
            Types
                Global HTTP(S)
                Global SSL Proxy
                Global TCP Proxy
                Regional
                Regional Internal
        DNS
            Cloud DNS
            Low latency
            High availability
            cost effective
            They are programmable, also can publish and manage millions of DNS zones and records using google cloud console. the command line interface or API
        CDN
            Edge cache - Has Global system of edge caches
            low latency
            reduced load
        Connecting Other Network with Google VPC
            IPSEC VPN Protocol
                Uses Cloud Router to make the connection dynamic
                Lets other network and google VPC exchange route information over the vpn using the Border Gateway protocol
                Not always the best option because of security conserns or bandwidth reliability
                Using this if you add a new subnet to yor Google VPC your ON-Permises network will get automatically routes to it.
            Direct Peering
                Putting a router in the same public datacenter as a google point of presence(POP)
                Using router to exchange traffic between networks
                More than 100 google points of presence around the world
            Carrier Peering
                Gives direct access from an on-permises network through a service provider network
                Not covered by Google service level lead agreement
            Dedicacted Interconnect
                Allows one or more direct ,private connections to googel
                Can be covered by up to 99.99% SLA
                Conncetions can be bcaked up by a VPN
